I live in the city of Cincinnati, in the state of OHIO, in the United States of America.

Three of my favorite books are
- *Mindstorms* by Seymour Papert
- *Welcome to the Monkey House* by Kurt Vonnegut
- *Persepolis* by Marjane Satrapi

Laser night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Linger in Denver.
2. Azura in Jerusalem.
3. Gemma in New York City.
